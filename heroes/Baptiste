Biotic Launcher also doubles as a healing device, lobbing projectiles that heal allies near the point of impact.

Details
    Healing per second: 55.55 - 77.77 (indirect - direct) while firing (49.42-68.93 overall w/reload)
    Cannot heal self.
    Projectile passes through full-health allies.
    Reloading Biotic Launcher replenishes the ammo for both the primary and alternate fire.
    Baptiste can alternate between the two modes of fire.
    There is a 0.144 seconds recovery to use primary fire after firing.
    The projectile can be destroyed while in air by Ability-dva3 Defense Matrix, Abilities-sigma3 Kinetic Grasp and Ability JavelinSpin Javelin Spin and reflected by Ability-genji2 Deflect, but the explosion is unaffected.
    Baptiste-ability4 Amplification Matrix affects all healing dealt, if the projectile passes through it. Splash healing alone going through is not amplified.

Activate to heal yourself and nearby allies instantly, with additional healing over time. Instant heal is doubled for targets less than half health.

Healing:
    40 (instant, >50% max HP)

Baptiste activates an intense regenerative burst that heals himself and nearby allies over time.

Details
    Healing per second = 10
    The heal-over-time effect is applied once upon activation. Allies can get out of range and continue to get healed.
    Although the ability has a casting animation, the healing over time is applied instantly, but begins healing after a delay, which means it cannot be interrupted by stuns, hacks or death.

    Toss a device that prevents allies from dying. The device can be destroyed.
Healing:
    Any deficit from 25% HP
Health:
    125
Cast time:
    0.8 second cast animation

Area of effect:
    6.5 meter radius
Projectile speed:
    60 m/s

Baptiste uses a device to create a field that prevents allies from dying. The generator can be destroyed.

Details
    Prevents the HP of Baptiste and his allies from going below 25%. It even prevents environmental death, but healing the HP lost this way will not give ultimate charge.
    Heroes with HP below 25% will instantly be healed to 25% when entering the field. Ability-ana3 Biotic Grenade can amplify or block this; if the healing is blocked, Immortality Field will still prevent all incoming damage.
    The device can be thrown and bounced off walls. The arc is identical to that of Biotic Launcher's alternate fire, except Immortality Field collides with the skybox.
    Both the thrown device and the field ignore barriers but can be blocked by terrain and terrain-like objects.
    Sombra can Ability Sombra Hack Hack the device instantly destroying Immortality Field.
    Placing a Tree of Life Icon Tree of Life on the device destroys it.
    The device can be placed on and lifted by Petal Platform Icon Petal Platform if the latter was deployed first.
    When the device expires, the field will linger for 0.5 seconds. If the generator is destroyed, the field will still linger, but not as long.
    Although the ability has a casting animation, the device is spawned the moment the button is pressed, and therefore cannot be cancelled mid-cast by a stun or hack.


Amplification Matrix Q
Baptiste-ability4
Cost:

Type
    Ultimate Ability
    Project a matrix that doubles the damage and healing of allied projectiles.
Damage:
    +100% damage amplified
Healing:
    +100% healing amplified
Cast time:
    instantly + recovery 0.24 s. for shoot
Duration:
    10 seconds
Max. range:
    35 meters
Area of effect:
    9x5 meter rectangle, with 1 meter beneath the ground

Baptiste creates a matrix that doubles the damage and healing effects of friendly projectiles that pass through it.

Details
    Damage per second: 
        ~258.2 while firing (self)
    Healing per second: 
        111.1 - 155.51 (indirect - direct) while firing (self)
    Before being deployed, the orientation can be changed by pressing the ultimate key again.
    Amplifies hitscan and projectile attacks alike, coming from any direction.
    This includes abilities that travel as a projectile but deal damage/healing in an AoE or as a DoT/HoT, such as Ability-mei4 Blizzard, Ability-ashe2 Dynamite and Ability Moira Biotic Orb Biotic Orb (note that it does not change the total damage/healing for Biotic Orb, just the rate of damage/healing), as long as (and only if) the projectile passes through.
    Cannot amplify the damage of melee-based projectiles such as Ability-Roadhog3 Chain Hook or Whip Shot Whip Shot.
    Amplification Matrix does not actually double damage/healing. When combined with other amplification abilities, they are added together. For example, Amplification Matrix (+100%) and Mercy's Damage Boost (+25%) will result in +125% damage (225% damage overall).
    Can be placed on payload or Petal Platform Icon Petal Platform.

    Ability is stationed wherever it's placed. So, if placed on top of a temporary or moving surface, like the Payload, it will remain in midair, even after the surface expires or moves.
    Can be destroyed by Ability Sombra EMP EMP.
