    Effect stacks per ally healed during Valkyrie
    Results in 13.75 hp/s normally and 15 hp/s per target during Ability-mercy6 Valkyrie.
    Self-healing is affected by healing modifiers both on the target and Mercy herself.
    This means the healing will not only be increased by amplified healing received effects on Caduceus Staff's target but also gain double benefit if both Mercy and the target she is healing are affected by it. For example, +50% healing received buff on both will result in +125% self-healing received from Sympathetic Recovery.

    Mercy engages one of two beams that connect to an ally. By maintaining the beams, she can either restore that ally’s health or increase the amount of damage they deal.
Details
    Heals an ally by 10.56 every 0.192 seconds.
    Primary fire creates a healing beam and secondary fire creates a damage amplifying beam that lock on to a nearby ally. They ignore barriers and will linger for 1.3 seconds if the target breaks line of sight or moves out of range. Mercy does not need to look at her target to maintain connection.
    In order to amplify a type's damage, Mercy must be boosting the hero when the projectile was fired. After that, it will be boosted even if Mercy stops boosting when it lands.
    Mercy gains ultimate charge equal to the damage that she amplifies, except from self-damage.
    Mercy's damage boost does not stack with itself.

    Vertical and horizontal speed are related. You can't have 9.0 meters per second of horizontal and vertical speed in same time.
    If the vertical speed is <0.25, then the horizontal maximum can be no more than 9.0 and vice versa.
    If your crosshair is exactly centered and you pinch forward/back and jump/ctrl then your vertical and horizontal speed will be 6.36 meters per second.
    If your crosshair is exactly centered and you pinch forward/back and jump/ctrl and right/left then your vertical speed = 4.50 and horizontal = 7.8.
