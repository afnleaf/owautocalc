    Ana’s rifle shoots darts that can restore health to her allies or deal ongoing damage to her enemies. She can use the rifle’s scope to zoom in on targets and make highly accurate shots.

Details
    Damage per second: ~93.75 while firing (83.33 overall w/ reload)
    Healing per second: ~93.75 while firing (83.33 overall w/ reload)
    Shots pass through full health allies and do not affect them.
    Scoped shots leave a tracer behind.
    Applies a damage/heal-over-time effect that can be cleansed. Health Packs cleanse the damage-over-time.
    Projectile size is treated as 0.3 meters for allies, making it easier to heal. It is smaller for enemies.
    Using melee or zooming in/out stops fire recovery.
    After the shot, the game raises the Ana camera (changes the facing angle) by 2 units, after which it starts lowering the character's camera to its previous value (a little bit changes it). Unlike Cassidy, Ana will not be able to shoot once the camera is back in position and will have to wait.

    Ana tosses a biotic bomb that deals damage to enemies and heals allies in a small area of effect. Affected allies briefly receive increased healing from all sources, while enemies caught in the blast cannot be healed for a few moments.
Details
    Passes through full HP allies.
    Affected allies receive 50% additional healing, including from Health Packs, while affected enemies cannot be healed at all.
    Stacks multiplicatively with other effects that amplify healing received.
    The regeneration of shields is treated as a form of healing, meaning allies regenerate their shields 50% faster and enemies cannot regenerate their shields until the effect expires.
    Has no effect on overhealth.
    The projectile can be destroyed while in air by Ability-dva3 Defense Matrix, Abilities-sigma3 Kinetic Grasp and Ability JavelinSpin Javelin Spin, but the explosion is unaffected.
    Biotic grenade can be reflected by Ability-genji2 Deflect.
    Baptiste-ability4 Amplification Matrix affects all damage and healing dealt, if the projectile passes through it. Splash damage/healing alone going through is not amplified.

    In FFA Deathmatch, Ana can use Nano Boost on herself.
