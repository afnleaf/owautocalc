    Movement Movement
    Jump onto a wall to ride along it.
Move. speed:
    +30% buff +2.5 meters per second (wall leap)
Cooldown:
    0.5 seconds
Details
    If Wall Jump On release is enabled, then while on a wall, you can press crouch to fall off it without making a jump.
    To start a Wall Ride, jump at a nearby wall and hold the Jump key. Lúcio will Wall Ride as long as it is held.
    If the option "Allow Backwards Wall Ride" is enabled, Lúcio will be able to start a Wall Ride midair without needing to look at the wall or needing to move prior to Wall Riding.
    Unlike most heroes, Lucio's speed does not decrease while flying with speed higher than 5.5 m/s.
    However, his speed begins to decrease if his speed in the air is more than double his speed on the ground.
    With healing aura, slow will occur at speeds above 11 m/s, with speed aura at speeds above 13.76 m/s, with speed aura + Amp It Up at speeds above 17.6 m/s.
    When looking down while wall riding and holding forward to press jump, Lucio will jump up at a speed of 4.12 m/s. If you look up, then the speed will be 9.12 m/s. However, in this cases, there will be practically no wall leap horizontal speed buff.
    If you look straight ahead during a wall ride and press jump, Lucio will jump up at a vertical speed of 6.54 m/s. By holding forward in advance, you can increase the vertical speed to 6.9 m/s without any penalty.

    Switches between two songs: Healing Boost heals nearby allies, and Speed Boost makes nearby allies move faster.
Healing:
    Allies: 
        16 per second
    Self: 
        10 per second
Cast time:
    0.192 seconds
Area of effect:
    12 meter radius
Move. speed:
    +25% buff

Lúcio continuously energizes himself — and nearby teammates — with music. He can switch between two songs: one amplifies movement speed, while the other regenerates health.

Details
    Co-op
    Both songs require line of sight and does not affect allies behind enemy barriers.
    If a teammate leaves the area, the current song effect lingers for 1 second, unless the song is switched.
    The switch can be done while reloading.
    The aura of speed affects the speed of movement on the surface and walls. Enabling/disabling it while flying does not affect speed unless your speed is greater than 11 m/s.
    If "hold to crossfade" enabled visually the aura switches after 0.208 seconds. However, to truly switch the aura, you need to hold down the button for at least 0.38 seconds.

    Protective waves radiate out from Lúcio’s Sonic Amplifier, briefly providing him and nearby allies with overhealth.
Health:
    750 overhealth
Cast time:
    0.7 + 0.8 seconds
Duration:
    6 seconds
Area of effect:
    30 meter radius

Details
    If Lúcio is or becomes airborne while casting Sound Barrier, the cast will not finish until he lands on a walkable surface, unless he is suspended in air by Ability-zarya4 Graviton Surge or Abilities-sigma5 Gravitic Flux, in which case the cast will go through mid-air.
    Lúcio does a small leap upon activation. This increases the cast time by ~0.06 seconds if Lúcio, under normal conditions, lands on the same level of elevation.
    When the cast finishes, there is approximately a 0.83 second period where allies can still receive the overhealth if they enter Sound Barrier's radius.
    Overhealth immediately starts decaying at a rate of 125 overhealth per second (12 overhealth every 0.096 seconds).
