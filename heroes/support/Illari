Details
    Heal per second: 
        37.5
    Healing prioritizes the hero with the lowest health percentage within the pylon's range.
    Cooldown starts immediately upon activation.
    If a new Pylon is deployed while one is still active, the old one will be destroyed.
    A deployed Pylon can be destroyed using the Interact key at any time. If it hasn't taken damage within the last 3 seconds, this has no effect on its cooldown.
    If the pylon is damaged by the enemy, a new pylon cannot be deployed for 3 seconds. If the pylon is destroyed during this time, either by the enemy or manually by the player, Healing Pylon goes on a longer cooldown, starting from the moment it was destroyed.
    Pylon can attach itself to terrain and terrain-like objects, like Ability-mei3 Ice Wall.
    Bounces off of barriers and other objects.
    Pylon can attach to payload, but not to the TS-1 robot or the barricade in Push.
    Pylon is destroyed if it is in the way of a moving payload or barricade (but not the robot).
    Healing Pylon can be placed on Petal Platform Icon Petal Platform and lifted by it regardless of which was placed first.
    Pylon is destroyed if a Tree of Life Icon Tree of Life is deployed on top of it.
    Deploying an Ability-mei3 Ice Wall or using Ability-mei2 Cryo-Freeze on the pylon covers it, blocking line of sight and preventing it from healing.
    If the pylon touches Ability-mei3 Ice Wall or stays within Ability-mei4 Blizzard, it will "freeze" and stop healing until those abilities end.
    If the object it was attached to expires or is destroyed the pylon falls on ground.
    The pylon has collision with heroes and blocks shots, but does not block line of sight for AoE.
    Ability-ashe4 B.O.B. will destroy the pylon if he collides with it. This will stop the charge.
    Stunning movement abilities, like Ability-reinhardt3 Charge or Shield Bash Shield Bash (during Rally Rally), can "stun" the pylon, briefly stopping its healing.
    Healing Pylon is unaffected by knockback.
    Pylon cannot be targeted by Icon-ability.tacticalvisor Tactical Visor, Ability-mccree4 Deadeye or Ability Moira Biotic Orb Biotic Orb.
    Pylon can be targeted by Ability-torbjorn3 Deploy Turret, Ability-symmetra2 Sentry Turret and Ability-ashe4 B.O.B..
    A deployed pylon can be teleported using Symmetra's Ability-symmetra4 Teleporter.
    Sombra can Ability Sombra Hack Hack the pylon, disabling it for 10 seconds.
    The pylon projectile before deployment cannot be blocked by Abilities-sigma3 Kinetic Grasp, Ability-dva3 Defense Matrix and Ability JavelinSpin Javelin Spin or reflected by Ability-genji2 Deflect, however the healing projectiles shot by it can.

Details
    Captive Sun is a channeled ability; it is interrupted by becoming stunned, knocked down or hacked, including subsidiary effects, consuming the ultimate charge.
    Launches Illari into the air granting her free flight for the duration and her next shot is replaced by solar energy ball.
    Rooted and hindered make Illari temporarily unable to fly, but do not prevent the activation or immediately end the ability.
    After the launch, the player has 4 seconds to fire the solar energy ball.
    The ball is automatically fired at the end of the timer.
    Projectile passes through enemies (but not shields) and explodes only upon contact with a shield, terrain or terrain-like object, like Ability-mei3 Ice Wall, or if it has travelled for 10 seconds.
    Any enemy heroes, including Ability-ashe4 B.O.B., damaged by the direct hit or splash of the solar energy ball are marked and slowed for 6 seconds.
    Slow slowly decays over the duration.
    If a marked enemy receives total of 90 damage after reductions or is killed, they will become "SUNSTRUCK", causing the mark to explode after 0.8 seconds dealing damage in an area.
    Damage from the direct hit and splash from Captive Sun does not count toward this, but the damage from Sunstruck explosion does.
    Only one mark can be active at a time. For example, if an allied Echo duplicates Illari and hits the same target with Captive Sun.
    If the target is hit before Sunstruck is triggered, the duration of the mark is refreshed.
    If the target is hit during Sunstruck explosion delay, a new mark will not be applied.
    The mark can be removed by Zarya's Ability-zarya2 Particle/Projected Barrier, Zenyatta's Ability-zenyatta4 Transcendence, D.Va's Ability-dva6 Call Mech or by becoming phased out, such as through Ability-reaper2 Wraith Form or Protection Suzu Icon Protection Suzu.
    However, if the target has already been Sunstruck, the explosion will happen regardless. Damage may still be prevented.
    Kiriko and Sombra can teleport, protecting themselves from the explosion. However, they carry the explosion with them, harming anyone around their destination. If a sunstruck ally happens to be there, they could explode.
    Mark explosion damage is mitigated by Block Icon Block and Power Block Power Block regardless of facing direction.
    The projectile can be destroyed while in air by Ability-dva3 Defense Matrix, Abilities-sigma3 Kinetic Grasp and Ability JavelinSpin Javelin Spin and reflected by Ability-genji2 Deflect, but the splash and Sunstruck explosion are unaffected.
    Direct damage and splash damage from Captive Sun are affected by Baptiste-ability4 Amplification Matrix, as long as the projectile passes through it. However, the Sunstruck explosion damage is not.
